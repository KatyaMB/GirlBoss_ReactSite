# React website
I created a copy of the Girl Boss home page (accurate at time of creation).<br>
This website utilises React components and has been split into reusable components.<br>
It also passes props between functional components.<br>
The website has been styles with custom CSS styles.

**To run the the site**
<br>
In Terminal execute: npm start

**Output**
